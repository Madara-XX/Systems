## 🚀 Quick Start (5 Steps)

### 1. Create Data Assets

**WeaponData:**
- Right-click in Project: `Create > RoombaRampage > Weapon Data`
- Create 3 presets: BasicGun, SpreadShot, RapidFire
- Configure stats (damage, fire rate, projectile speed)

**EnemyData:**
- Right-click in Project: `Create > RoombaRampage > Enemy Data`
- Create 2 presets: BasicEnemy, FastEnemy
- Configure stats (health, speed, damage)

### 2. Create Projectile Prefab

```
GameObject (Projectile)
├── Rigidbody (no gravity, Y frozen)
├── Capsule Collider (trigger: true)
├── Projectile.cs
└── Visual (child GameObject with mesh)
```

### 3. Set Up Player

```
Player GameObject (Tag: "Player")
├── PlayerInput.cs (existing)
├── PlayerHealth.cs (existing)
└── WeaponController.cs (NEW - add this)
    └── Assign: WeaponData asset
```

### 4. Create Enemy Prefab

```
Enemy GameObject (Tag: "Enemy")
├── Rigidbody (no gravity, Y frozen)
├── Collider (trigger: false)
├── EnemyHealth.cs
├── EnemyAI.cs
├── Enemy.cs
└── Visual (child GameObject with mesh)
```
Assign EnemyData to all three scripts.

### 5. Set Up Scene

```
Scene
├── Player (with WeaponController)
├── ProjectilePool (empty GameObject + ProjectilePool.cs)
├── ScoreManager (empty GameObject + ScoreManager.cs)
└── EnemySpawner (empty GameObject + EnemySpawner.cs)
    └── Assign: EnemyData assets to spawn list
```

**Test:** Play scene, hold Attack button to fire at spawning enemies!

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

**Issue:** Projectiles don't spawn
→ Check: ProjectilePool GameObject in scene, WeaponData has prefab assigned

**Issue:** Projectiles don't hit enemies
→ Check: Enemy tag is "Enemy", projectile collider is trigger, enemy has EnemyHealth

**Issue:** Enemies don't move
→ Check: Player tag is "Player", Rigidbody Y is frozen, EnemyAI has EnemyData

**Issue:** Enemies don't damage player
→ Check: PlayerHealth component exists, enemy collider is NOT trigger

**Issue:** No score when enemies die
→ Check: ScoreManager in scene, EnemyData scoreValue > 0

**Issue:** Poor performance
→ Increase AI update interval, limit max enemies per wave, check pool settings

## 💡 Tips

1. **Enable Debug Info** on all components during testing to see gizmos and status
2. **Start Simple:** Test with one weapon and one enemy type first
3. **Tweak Values:** Use ScriptableObjects to quickly adjust balance without coding
4. **Profile Early:** Use Unity Profiler to catch performance issues
5. **Use Layers:** Set up collision layers for better control and performance
