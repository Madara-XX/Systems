## Architecture Highlights

### Component-Based Design

The player is split into 4 focused MonoBehaviour components:
- **PlayerController**: Movement physics
- **PlayerInput**: Input handling
- **PlayerHealth**: Health management
- **PlayerVisuals**: Visual feedback

Each component has a single responsibility and can be tested independently.

### Data-Driven Configuration

Two ScriptableObjects provide configuration and communication:
- **PlayerStats**: All tunable parameters (movement, health, combat)
- **PlayerEvents**: Event channel for decoupled communication

This allows:
- Easy balancing without code changes
- Multiple configuration profiles (difficulty modes, character variants)
- Designer-friendly Inspector-based tuning
- Hot-reload of stats during play mode

### Event-Driven Communication

PlayerEvents ScriptableObject acts as a message bus:
- Player systems raise events (damage, death, etc.)
- Other systems subscribe (UI, audio, game manager)
- No direct dependencies between systems
- Easy to add new listeners without modifying player code

### Physics-First Movement

Movement uses Rigidbody2D forces, not direct position manipulation:
- Natural collision response
- Vehicle-like acceleration/deceleration feel
- Drift effect for steering
- Smooth, responsive control
- Performance-optimized (all physics in FixedUpdate)

---

## Key Features Implemented

### Movement System
- Acceleration-based movement (15 units/s² default)
- Max speed limiting (10 units/s default)
- Rotation toward movement direction (150°/s default)
- Drift factor for steering feel (0.92 = subtle drift)
- Friction when no input (gradual slowdown)
- Arena boundary clamping (keeps player in bounds)
- Speed boost support (temporary multiplier with duration)
- Impulse force support (for knockback, explosions)

### Input System
- Full New Input System integration
- Move input (WASD/Left Stick)
- Look input (Mouse/Right Stick)
- Attack input (Left Mouse/Right Trigger)
- Interact input (E/A Button)
- Helper methods for world position/direction conversion
- Input enable/disable state management
- Debug visualization

### Health System
- Damage application with validation
- Invulnerability frames (1.5s default)
- Death detection and event broadcasting
- Healing with max health cap
- Optional health regeneration (configurable rate)
- Collision-based auto-damage (tag-based)
- Context menu test methods for debugging

### Visual Feedback
- Damage flash effect (3 flashes, red tint)
- Invulnerability flashing (sprite toggle every 0.1s)
- Death fade effect (0.5s alpha fade to 0)
- Event-driven automatic responses
- Sprite management (set sprite, set color)
- Reset visuals on respawn

### Debug Features
- Debug gizmos (arena boundaries, velocity, forward direction)
- Inspector toggles for debug visualization
- Context menu test methods (damage, heal, death, reset)
- OnGUI debug displays for runtime state
- Subscriber count logging for events

## Next Steps - Immediate Actions

### 1. Create ScriptableObject Assets

**PlayerStats Asset**:
1. Open Unity Editor
2. Navigate to `Assets/_Project/Data/Player/` (create folder if needed)
3. Right-click > Create > RoombaRampage > Player Stats
4. Name it `PlayerStats_Default`
5. Configure default values in Inspector

**PlayerEvents Asset**:
1. Navigate to `Assets/_Project/Data/Events/` (create folder if needed)
2. Right-click > Create > RoombaRampage > Player Events
3. Name it `PlayerEvents`
4. This will be the single global event channel

### 2. Create Player Prefab

**Player GameObject Setup**:
1. Create new GameObject: GameObject > Create Empty
2. Name it "Player"
3. Add components:
   - Rigidbody2D (configure from docs)
   - CircleCollider2D (radius 0.5, not trigger)
   - SpriteRenderer (add roomba sprite)
   - PlayerController script
   - PlayerInput script
   - PlayerHealth script

8. Drag to `Assets/_Project/Prefabs/Player/` to save as prefab

### 3. Create Test Scene

**Testing Scene Setup**:
1. Create new scene: `Assets/Scenes/Testing/PlayerControllerTest.unity`
2. Add Player prefab to scene at (0, 0, 0)
3. Add Camera (if not present) at (0, 0, -10)
4. Create arena walls using 2D colliders
5. Add ground sprite or tilemap for visual reference
6. Test movement with WASD

### 4. Configure Physics Layers

### 5. Test and Tune

**Movement Feel Testing**:
1. Enter Play Mode
2. Test WASD movement - should feel responsive but vehicle-like
3. Test rotation - should turn toward movement direction
4. Test speed - should accelerate to max speed in ~1 second
5. Test stopping - should decelerate smoothly when input released
6. Tune PlayerStats values in Inspector during Play Mode
7. Copy tuned values back to asset when satisfied

**Health Testing**:

## Performance Considerations

### Optimizations Implemented
- All component references cached in Awake()
- All physics updates in FixedUpdate()
- Zero allocations in Update/FixedUpdate (no new/Instantiate)
- Event unsubscribe in OnDisable (prevents memory leaks)
- Coroutines used for timed effects (invulnerability, speed boost)
- Object pooling architecture prepared (for future projectiles)

### Performance Targets
- **60 FPS minimum** on target hardware
- **< 0.5ms per frame** for all player scripts combined
- **0 GC allocations** in Update/FixedUpdate (after warmup)
- **Physics fixed timestep**: 0.02s (50 Hz)
- **Input latency**: < 16ms

### Profiling Recommendations
1. Use Unity Profiler to measure frame time
2. Check PlayerController.FixedUpdate time (should be < 0.3ms)
3. Check PlayerInput.Update time (should be < 0.1ms)
4. Monitor GC allocations (should be 0 bytes after warmup)
5. Test on target hardware (PC, mobile, console)

## Known Limitations & Future Work

### Current Limitations
1. **No combat system yet** - PlayerInput captures attack input but no weapon implemented
2. **No enemy interaction** - Collision damage coded but needs enemy system
3. **No upgrade system** - Speed boost method exists but no upgrade manager
4. **No audio** - Events ready but no audio integration
5. **No particle effects** - Visual effects coded but need particle systems
6. **No camera shake** - Integration point ready but no shake system

### Future Enhancements
1. **Advanced movement**:
   - Boost/dash ability (quick burst of speed)
   - Strafe movement option (circle-strafe enemies)
   - Wall slide mechanic
   - Jump/hop mechanic (avoid ground hazards)

2. **Advanced health**:
   - Shield system (absorbs damage before health)
   - Armor/resistance stats
   - Damage types (physical, energy, etc.)
   - Damage over time effects

3. **Advanced visuals**:
   - Sprite animation (roomba spinning brushes)
   - Directional sprites (8-way facing)
   - Trail renderer for speed trail
   - Custom shader effects (hologram, glitch)

4. **Quality of life**:
   - Save/load player stats
   - Keybinding remapping
   - Controller support (gamepad)
   - Accessibility options

## Code Quality Metrics

### Documentation
- **100% XML documentation** on public methods/properties
- **Tooltip attributes** on all SerializeField properties
- **Header attributes** for Inspector organization
- **Context menu methods** for testing/debugging
- **Comprehensive inline comments** for complex logic

### Unity Best Practices
- **Component caching** in Awake() (not per-frame GetComponent)
- **SerializeField** for private Inspector fields
- **Property accessors** for read-only state exposure
- **OnValidate** for Inspector value validation
- **RequireComponent** attributes for dependencies
- **Namespace organization** (RoombaRampage.Player)

### Code Structure
- **Single Responsibility Principle** - each component does one thing
- **Clear method names** - self-documenting code
- **Region organization** - logical grouping of related methods
- **Consistent formatting** - follows C# conventions
- **No magic numbers** - constants and SerializeField for all values

### Performance
- **Zero allocations** in hot paths (Update/FixedUpdate)
- **Cached references** for all components
- **Coroutines** for timed operations (not Update loops)
- **Early returns** to avoid unnecessary work
- **Vector2 reuse** instead of repeated allocation
