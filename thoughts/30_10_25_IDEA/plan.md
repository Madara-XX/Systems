# Main game idea 
 Bullet hell driving rouguelike game. 
 You steer angry roomba like robot which shoots lasers, bullets and other crazy stuff all around, slaying swarms of nanotechnology modified organisms and robots which invade his home while his owners are absent. 
 Dynamic action with driving experience, combining driving/ bullethell genres with funny viralable dialogs / messages from the roomba while its driving, and funny named skills/parts.
Each game should take up to 10 minutes, with waves of mobs and bosses from time to time. 
Lots of skills to choose from and lots of levelling up, boxes with random loot, charging stations healing roomba.
In between driving (after each level) roomba goes to main charging station to upgrade itself and prepare for next battle.
